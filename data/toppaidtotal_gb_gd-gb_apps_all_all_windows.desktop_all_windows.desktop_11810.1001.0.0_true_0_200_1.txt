Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\r\n\r\nYou can choose between a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realize your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system!\r\n\r\nAvailable ingame: SlopeMania!\r\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences. The \"Crazy Levels\" are the real brainteasers and require out-of-the-box thinking and unusual solutions.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHVNL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Survivalcraft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.35161.9007199266248685.47303be2-ecd3-45df-80b3-85ce086101d3.1c96e12e-7ae7-410d-ad26-af5c41a05512","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21823.9007199266248685.01c6dd15-b2c7-4b7f-98fb-9453b2a8dd87.06a81dfa-6f31-48ad-a054-e834deeeffd2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2724.9007199266248685.3f955cf6-6236-4f29-a241-5885b95b985e.472eef10-4cf1-4785-bcba-8a6aee3075e1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£3.29","Price":3.29,"AverageRating":4.1,"RatingsCount":"167","PackageFamilyNames":["20961CandyRufusGames.Survivalcraft_c7jxg4av36ap6"],"ContentIds":["a4b4f506-706c-089d-34f4-8e76f9ce2b62","6f594fc7-cd97-ce7d-a36e-11fd57b08a8a","a03df1d8-c81b-f637-bdf8-4a4e13d3d40b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"You are marooned on the shores of an infinite blocky world.

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

Handle weapons with real-life movements, freely explore a post-apocalyptic world, and put your survival skills to the test in VR - putting the undead back to rest is more thrilling than ever before.\r\n\r\nOnline Multiplayer functionality is coming soon!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NB5JZK0WK4H","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"3d Earth for PC","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30177.13523775855628660.2e7836ff-7e24-4858-b360-8041b5b3ba83.1abd595c-c4e6-4bb0-9bf3-8c74184c173b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61848.13523775855628660.3ce26e9c-11e6-4518-8918-58f84214332a.89779f75-4248-41fe-b0de-e730e9303d6f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["54166varapps.GoforEarth3d_avrsb3f2ahma0"],"ContentIds":["7fe10901-efd8-9b6e-7e9e-fb93fdf4846f","178d76e8-64db-0ff9-8e3f-184e109c7e2b","f78a463d-3afe-49b1-a813-591785b64cc0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"3d Earth for PC app is designed to use Google Earth on Windows PC.

They might be from when you imported photos from your camera twice, or downloaded the same movie to two different locations. Maybe you have a long-forgotten backup lurking somewhere on your system, or maybe you have duplicate albums from merging two music libraries together.\r\n\r\nFinding these stealthy space hogs is tedious. Disko Duplicate Cleaner does it for you – it's fast, safe, and automatic. Reclaim precious storage space in just two taps. It uses a proprietary scanning engine to search your device for duplicate files. \r\n\r\nIt's smart – the accurate scanner shows you a list of every detected duplicate file in just seconds. And to help you browse the results any matched images are previewed right inside the app, while matched music and videos indicate song duration and bitrate.\r\n\r\nIt's FAST – it scans thousands of files per minute with no false matches.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to use – its intuitive previewer automatically shows you the contents of suspected duplicates. And it's safe – it removes duplicates to the Recycle Bin for easy undoing, and by default it won't touch system files.\r\n\r\nDisko Duplicate Cleaner is made exclusively for the Windows Store. It's brought to you by the same team behind the popular Disko File Scanner, the five-star rated disk utility featured across the web. All our apps are backed by our team of professional technical support experts in case you get stuck. \r\n\r\nGet gigabytes of storage back from junk files now with Disko Duplicate Cleaner.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4LZSV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Association Football Club Manager","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28467.13510798887423817.da0beebc-4f37-47d2-9eec-30bd57819eaa.1324549b-5c66-48e4-b0d9-6cad8adcf195","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64649.13510798887423817.5e72e6d1-940d-412d-b136-796f3c15803a.5528405c-6598-4318-aa62-75332f4ce415","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53359.13510798887423817.24133e69-78b7-48d1-ac5b-c9188ce6beb9.03331d1d-82f0-4e72-9d98-d1f60c6e7d74","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13469.13510798887423817.4c621255-4440-403c-a463-e6f33bf551c1.d037216c-1aaf-42ec-b7e0-0fa4aad6ec73","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40902.13510798887423817.8a5119d2-3f85-4b49-9bcb-fb926a31fa87.e275b751-2861-4467-8d38-614566887691","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14518.13510798887423817.65c7cde6-987f-40ab-9c55-e89020206544.411c438c-ef1e-4f04-a865-f29210fc183a","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64913.13510798887423817.e2f4a841-2d71-41c1-85af-fca5dfb7ad31.5778cb11-1fac-4618-a7e2-294745cac896","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38265.13510798887423817.4e7b249a-12c8-4748-8186-4cbfc31ee188.47951cb3-2865-481e-8ec0-24d681bec38a","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24960.13510798887423817.047e0dec-c683-4e7b-ad60-7ea57675f48c.3917308f-9944-490a-818c-00e6763cf08f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.29","Price":1.29,"AverageRating":1.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["75CharonSoftware.AssociationFootballClubManager_npmhh3mpf6xfa"],"ContentIds":["b4841e06-78f5-43a5-c952-760845640f12"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Select and manage any of the Premier or Football League club each with real financial abilities.

is a brand-new title from the creators of This War of Mine. It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\r\n\r\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...\r\n\r\n...who will you become in the process?\r\n\r\nMAKE THE LAW\r\nSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\r\n\r\nWEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES\r\nSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\r\n\r\nDEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE FROSTLAND\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\r\n\r\nGO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN\r\nThe main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

terminal windows. Along with XTerm/ANSI/VT100/VT102/VT52 terminal emulations and TELNET/TCP/Serial/Bluetooth connection types, Token2Shell supports comprehensive SSH2 authentication and cryptographic methods.\r\n\r\nToken2Shell also supports Windows 10 Mobile smartphones and ready to run flawlessly in Continuum mode.\r\n\r\nPlease visit http://token2shell.com for more information.\r\n\r\n// USAGE TIPS & NOTES\r\n\r\n- Double-tap toggles the scroll-back mode on and off. Once it's activated, you can drag or swipe the terminal screen to view previous lines (scroll-back mode is automatically triggered by dragging or swiping in full window mode).\r\n- On-screen keyboard is activated when you tap the cursor in Mobile devices.\r\n- In Mobile devices, tapping a session tab and closing its popup menu without selecting any menu (ex. pressing the Back button) also activates the on-screen keyboard.\r\n- Some features are disabled or hidden for Windows 10 Mobile devices based on its available memory (ex. background option may not available on smartphones with less than 2GB of memory).\r\n\r\n// RECENT IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n- \"Clear Scrollback\" is added under the \"Terminal\" menu. If you want to save some previous lines, you can scroll back (SHIFT+UP) first and then select the menu; the text line buffer is cleared up to the currently visible top line.\r\n- ALT+SHIFT+P now takes a snapshot of a terminal window with its title bar and frame border. If you just want the content area, press ALT+P.\r\n- Layout Freezer is added for saving and restoring the layout of opened terminal windows\r\n- New cipher \"chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\" is added\r\n- TCP Direct connection method now supports TLS 1.2 encryption and can be used for directly connecting to HTTPS servers\r\n- More host key types are added: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256, ecdsa-sha2-nistp384, ecdsa-sha2-nistp521, ssh-ed25519\r\n- More key exchange algorithms are added: curve25519-sha256@libssh.org, ecdh-sha2-nistp256, ecdh-sha2-nistp384, ecdh-sha2-nistp521, diffie-hellman-group-exchange-sha256\r\n- Now supports Bluetooth/RFCOMM communication. This feature can be handy when you're developing or debugging a custom Bluetooth service for IoT devices. For an example of such usage with Windows IoT on Raspberry Pi 2, please visit http://token2shell.com/howto/bluetooth-iot-sample\r\n- Proprietary printing mode (ESC[2016i) for directly previewing and printing a PDF file now supported (http://token2shell.com/howto/local-print)\r\n- Keyboard shortcuts CTRL+SHIFT+C and CTRL+SHIFT+V are added for copy and paste respectively\r\n- CTRL+SHIFT+A keyboard shortcut is added for selecting all buffered terminal lines; Token2Shell first enables its 'Find' text mode and then selects all text.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PMRSHM8NQPC","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Media Player HD for Windows.","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30807.14292551463224190.d21627e1-292e-40cd-bfc4-82d05744b2b1.b00089a9-0c64-40b1-b6ba-807c4530cc46","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["4517kiran30.44222385B0E74_q07648fssd04r"],"ContentIds":["a37a1ff5-4c59-96e0-d113-a5b4c2d6e2ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a Media Player HD app and plays all the videos and audio format files in HD & normal form.

If you've ever uploaded photos to a photo printing service, you've seen the option for wallet prints. Typically wallets will be printed as 4 images on a 4x6 or 5x7 sheet. Photo printers charge a premium for this service. Individual wallet-size images cost a fraction of their regular rate when you put them on a 4x6 image and send that to the printing service as a normal 4x6 print.\r\n\r\nGreat for scrapbooking\r\n• Make your scrapbook pages more interesting! PhotoSheet gives you control over the size and layout of images for the scrapbook layout you're working on.\r\n• Support for variable number of images: There are a host of sheet layouts offering space for anywhere from just 2 images to over 30!\r\n• Tweak the layout! You can change the size and position of individual images within the layout.\r\n• Make a sheet of 16 1\" x 1.5\" images that fit inside slide mounts.\r\n• Adjust the spacing and add rounded corners to create the vintage photo print look.\r\n• Select an image and use two fingers or your mouse wheel to zoom in and reposition images in their slots.\r\n• PhotoSheet includes a host of custom page layouts you can use directly or as inspiration for new page layouts of your own. The layouts are optimized for a variety of popular scrapbooking page sizes, and you can even change the spacing or soften the corners of the photos in your page!\r\n\r\nCollage Prints\r\n• Use your photo printer to fill those photo collage picture frames in your home. If you have too many photos to fit in the frame, this software is handy for fitting multiple pictures into a single 4x6 slot in the frame. See what the sheet will look like, rearrange the photos on the sheet, and control the rotation of individual photos.\r\n\r\nPackage Prints\r\n• Automatically rotate photos to make the best use of individual slots in the layout. A great option if you are planning on cutting out the photo after printing.\r\n• Fill a single sheet with copies of a single image, great for wallet photos or giving package prints to friends.\r\n\r\nEasy to use\r\n• PhotoSheet Imperial and Metric paper sizes! All of the A's and B's and P's are there for your choosing! If your favorite paper size is not in the list, don't dismay: you can enter any sheet size you like, in inches or centimeters!\r\n• PhotoSheet remembers your settings from one session to the next! If you frequently use the same layout or sheet size, you'll love this.\r\n• The film strip holds all of the photos you're working with, and page views help you build multiple pages using the same layout! Create package prints for several photos at once!\r\n• Choose a different layout and automatically fill the open spaces with unused photos, or gather images together to use fewer pages!\r\n• \"Remove\" buttons on filmstrip items, pages, and layout cells make adjustments easy when you change your mind!\r\n• Images can be repositioned and resized inside their layout cells - Select the image first, then drag the image or roll your mouse wheel to zoom.

You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems.
